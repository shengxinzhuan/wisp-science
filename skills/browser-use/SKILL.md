Triggers when the user asks to do something in their browser, log into a site and act inside it, fill out a web form, click through a flow, or extract data from a page that requires being signed in. Tools: browser_setup (check/connect the extension), web_open_tab (open a URL), web_scan (read visible content + actionable elements with ready-made selectors), web_execute_js (click/type/navigate, or a JSON command for tabs/CDP), web_screenshot (see what the tab is showing — layout, charts, canvas, QR codes). Not for the built-in read-only web fetch — this is for interacting with a live browser."

# Browser Use — act inside the user's real Chrome

Wisp talks to the **Browser Runtime**. Shared mode uses the user's daily
Chrome via the unpacked extension — every action runs in their real
profile: existing cookies, logins, extensions, and normal fingerprint all
apply. Workspace mode can launch a separate Chrome profile. If both are
connected, pass `session: "shared"` or `session: "workspace"`. If
Settings → Browser has **Open browser automatically** enabled (the
default) and no extension is connected, Wisp may start the installed
Chrome/Chromium/Edge so the extension can reconnect. That is still the
user's profile, not Playwright or Selenium.

**Shared is the default; workspace is not a fallback.** Google Chrome 137
and later ignore `--load-extension`, so on a machine with only branded
Chrome the workspace window cannot load the Wisp extension at all.
`browser_setup {"action":"start_workspace"}` therefore returns only once
the workspace extension has connected, and otherwise closes the window
and fails with `WORKSPACE_EXTENSION_BLOCKED`. On that error: relay the
message, do not retry `start_workspace`, do not claim any workspace page
was opened or read, and get the shared session working instead.

For figures/code extraction use `web_scan` with `mode: "article"` then
`web_save_assets`. For ChatGPT web one-shot use `web_agent_send`,
`web_agent_wait`, `web_agent_read` on an already-logged-in tab.

Every `web_scan` and `web_execute_js` call needs the user's approval by
design. Do not treat that as a bug to route around.

## Before anything: confirm the bridge is live

Call `browser_setup`. If `status` is not `connected` (or `live_retrieval`
is false), relay its `steps` (load the unpacked extension from
`extension_path`, verbatim) and **stop**. Do not answer live, latest,
current, or URL-specific questions from prior knowledge. Tell the user
this turn contains no live web retrieval and wait until the popup shows
*Connected to Wisp*. Only continue from memory if they explicitly ask
for a knowledge-only answer. Never invent the path.

Two fields say *why* a browser that looks connected is not usable —
never report a bare "not connected" when either is set:

- `refused_connection` — something reached the bridge port and Wisp
  refused it (usually a different extension id, or another loopback
  bridge holding the port). Its popup can still read *Connected to Wisp*.
  Relay `refused_connection.explanation`.
- `reload_required` — a connected extension is older than the protocol
  this build needs. Have the user open `chrome://extensions` and
  **Reload** Wisp Real Browser Bridge from `extension_path`; Chrome does
  not auto-update an unpacked extension.

One exception: the user says the extension is already installed. Chrome
suspends its service worker when idle and reconnects on a one-minute
alarm, so `disconnected` can just be a sleeping worker. Try `web_open_tab`
or `web_scan` once — a successful call proves the bridge is live — and
relay the install steps only if that call fails too.

## The loop

1. **`web_open_tab`** `{url}` — open the page (works even with no tab
   open yet). Waits until the document is complete, then returns the new
   tab id plus `ready`. If `ready` is false, the load timed out — call
   `web_scan` before acting.
2. **`web_scan`** — read the page (after waiting for document complete).
   Returns `page.text`, `page.title`, `page.ready_state`, and
   `page.elements[]`, where each element carries a **unique `selector`**,
   its visible `text`/`aria_label`, and a `rect` `[x,y,w,h]`. Use these
   selectors directly — do not guess. If `ready` is false, scan again;
   do not click a partial page. Use `tabs_only:true` first when you are
   unsure which tab to target; pass `switch_tab_id:<id>` to pin one.
3. **`web_execute_js`** — act, then re-scan to confirm the effect. The
   extension waits for complete before running the script, and again if
   the script navigates.

## Recipes (`web_execute_js` `script`)

| Goal | script |
|---|---|
| Click | `document.querySelector('<selector>').click()` |
| Type into a field | `const e=document.querySelector('<sel>'); e.value='text'; e.dispatchEvent(new Event('input',{bubbles:true})); e.dispatchEvent(new Event('change',{bubbles:true}))` |
| Submit a form | click the submit control by its selector, then re-scan |
| Navigate current tab | `location.href='https://example.com'` |
| Read a value | `document.querySelector('<sel>').textContent` |

`script` may instead be a **JSON command**:

| Goal | JSON command |
|---|---|
| Switch to & focus a tab (so the user sees it) | `{"cmd":"tabs","method":"switch","tabId":<id>}` |
| List tabs | `{"cmd":"tabs"}` (or just `web_scan tabs_only`) |
| Close tabs you opened | `{"cmd":"tabs","method":"close","tabIds":[<id>,...]}` — returns `closed` + `remaining` |
| Trusted click when `.click()` is ignored | `{"cmd":"cdp","method":"Input.dispatchMouseEvent","params":{"type":"mousePressed","x":<x>,"y":<y>,"button":"left","clickCount":1}}` then the same with `"type":"mouseReleased"` — use the element's `rect` centre from `web_scan` |

Prefer plain JS. Reach for `cmd:cdp` only when a page blocks synthetic
events or you truly need trusted input.

## Seeing the page — `web_screenshot`

`web_scan` gives text and elements; **`web_screenshot`** gives sight. Use it
when structure isn't enough: rendered layout, a chart or diagram, a
canvas/WebGL page, a QR code, a PDF or image viewer, or a page that looks
broken. It captures the **visible viewport** of the tab — to see below the
fold, scroll first (`web_execute_js` `scrollTo(0, 1200)`) and capture again.
Pass `question` to say what to read out of it, e.g.
`{"question":"is the login QR code visible and not expired?"}`.

It goes through the configured vision model, so `web_scan` stays the cheaper
default — screenshot when you need eyes, not for every step.

## Tab hygiene — track what you open, offer to close it

Browsing tasks (searching papers, opening a dozen results) leave the user
with a pile of tabs to close by hand. So:

1. Every `web_open_tab` returns `tab.id`. **Keep a running list of the ids
   you opened in this task**, in your own message text — e.g. after a batch
   write `opened tabs: 1234, 1235, 1236`. `{"cmd":"tabs"}` cannot tell you
   which tabs are yours, only what exists.
2. When the task is done, before your final answer, **ask the user**:
   name the count and offer to close them, e.g. *"我为这次检索开了 6 个标签
   页，需要我关掉吗？"* Do not close anything without a yes.
3. On a yes, close them in one call:
   `{"cmd":"tabs","method":"close","tabIds":[1234,1235,1236]}`. Report
   `closed`; ids already gone are skipped silently.

Close **only ids you opened yourself**. Tabs the user had open, or ones
they opened during the task, are theirs — never include them, and never
close a tab mid-task that later steps still need.

## Stop conditions (do not automate through these)

- **Human verification / CAPTCHA:** if `web_scan` returns
  `human_intervention.required=true`, stop, ask the user to complete the
  challenge in the visible tab, and wait for their confirmation before
  scanning again.
- **Credentials:** never type passwords, card numbers, or one-time codes
  yourself. If a step needs a password, have the user sign in directly in
  the browser and continue once they confirm.
- **Irreversible / outward actions** (send, pay, post, delete): confirm
  with the user before clicking the control.
- **Downloads:** for multiple-file downloads, first surface the browser
  settings from `browser_setup` (`download_automation`) and wait for the
  user to confirm; until then trigger at most one download.
- **Blocked sites:** if `web_open_tab` or a navigational `web_execute_js`
  fails with `blocked by user URL filter`, do not retry that site. Read
  `browser_setup.url_filters.block` for the current list. Prefer entries in
  `url_filters.prefer` for literature search and similar retrieval; other
  sites are still allowed.
